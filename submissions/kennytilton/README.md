# SithTrak&trade;

Welcome to the Matrix&trade; implementation of The Flux Challenge&trade;, just one hundred fifty-six lines of indeterminable elegance as defined by the Challenge.

>  Let's define code elegance to be "the ability of a programmer to easily understand
>  the program's flow and state coordination, being completely familiar with the tools
>  used but completely unfamiliar with the codebase.

Indeterminable because no one else is familiar *at all* with Matrix, so we lack a test dummy. But this could be my Submission Committee since the Matrix data flow engine has much in common with their projects:

* Michael Westrate, author of [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)
* Alan Dipert and Micha Niskin, crew behind [Javelin](https://github.com/hoplon/javelin)
* Yang Bo, author of [binding.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala)

Vast amounts of other prior/concurrent art exist. 

````
Fun side note. This solution started at 84 lines until we belatedly grokked
what was wanted in aborting XHR requests. This requirement means interrupting
what would otherwise be simple data flow.

The good news is that the data flow paradigm could handle the unusual "flow", the
bad news is that it did almost double the code required.
````

## Running the beast
First, grab the whole Challenge:
```` bash
git clone https://github.com/kennytilton/flux-challenge.git
````
Now start up the supporting servers:
````
cd flux-challenge/server
npm install
npm start
````
You should see a couple of announcements about the servers starting up. The `npm install` is needed only the first time.

Now visit `http://localhost:3000/s/` in your browser. Look for `kennytilton` and click.

What should happen is [defined here](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge/blob/master/README.md). The tl;dr:
* show where Obi-Wan is as he moves around;
* start by looking up and showing a hardcoded Sith (3616);
* bracket that Sith with master above and apprentice below, if anys;
* scroll up and down two at a time;
* always lookup afresh when scrolling to get latest info;
* if a lookup for Sith is active when the Sith gets scrolled off, abort the lookup;
* if Obi-Wan is on the planet of a Sith:
* ...highlight that Sith in red;
* ...disable scrolling.

## Hacking data flow
To play with my code, first pull down the substantial Google Closure git submodule thus:
````bash
cd ../submissions/kennytilton/js/closure-library
git submodule init
git submodule update
````
Now:
* open `index-dev.html` in your browser
* as you edit the `js/SithTrak.js` code, just refresh the page

### Bundling
the script `trak-es5` will rebuild `dist/SithTrak.js` with simple optimizations. Open `index.html` to run that. No luck yet with advanced optimizations, and we are starting to think Matrix is too dynamic for the google closure compiler advanced mode.

## Discussion
The elegance definition above presents another difficulty: data flow programs do not *have* program flow. The data flows and the UI shape simply conforms to the data. In a sense, the data flow ends with the dynamically altered UI, which itself is just data. 

To make things worse, thanks to some clever coding the data flow is transparent, so you cannot even see that. Reference a variable and you are subscribed to it. Set such a variable and everyone gets notified. It Just Works&trade;. 

This, by the way, is where Facebook erred with React: they missed that the view *is* part of the model. By addressing only the view, they covered the easy part. The whole challenge of UI programming is managing state in an environment with interpendent parts responding to asynchronous input data. But Facebook punted on state, told us to make do as best we could, then changed their mind and told us to use Flux&trade;. As for data flow, Facebook [rejects it](https://reactjs.org/docs/design-principles.html). (Scroll down to "Scheduling"). Excerpts:

> The control over scheduling would be harder for us to gain if we let the user
> directly compose views with a “push” based paradigm common in some variations of 
> Functional Reactive Programming. We want to own the “glue” code.

And:

> There is an internal joke in the team that React should have been 
> called “Schedule” because React does not want to be fully “reactive”.

Instead we have Flux:

![Flux circular flow diagram](https://github.com/kennytilton/flux-challenge/blob/master/submissions/kennytilton/dist/facebook-flux-react.jpg)

So our data swoops around in a highly purposed and constrained circle like a stadium crowd doing the wave, creating the illusion of control. But what if the hot dog guy is over there and the beer lady is over there? QED.

Under the data flow paradigm, no one tells anyone what data they cannot have or when they can have it. Here is the view of a Sith -- not the latest version after a big refactoring, but it makes the point:

```` js
function sithView( c, sithId) {
    return li({ style: cF( c=> c.md.withObi ? "color:red": null)},
              {
                sithId: sithId,
                lookup: cF( c=> {
                    if (c.md.sithId > 0)
                        return new mxXHR( DARK_JEDI_URL + c.md.sithId)
                }),
    
                info: cF( c=> (c.md.lookup && c.md.lookup.okResult)),
    
                withObi: cF( c=> c.md.info.homeworld.name === sithApp.obiLoc.name)
              }
           , h3({ content: cF( c=> (i = c.md.par.info)? i.name : "")})
           , h6({ content: cF( c=> (i = c.md.par.info)? i.homeworld.name : "")}));
}
````
Glossary:
* `cF` creates a formulaic Cell
* `cI` creates an input Cell
* In `c.md`, `c` is the Cell and `md` is the proxy object corresponding to a DOM element.
* `c.md.par` is the parent of `c.md`

We will first look at the functional derivations which together set up the data flow we will trace later. We will have to bounce around the properties of the beast because UIs are a network of information.

First we have a Sith's entry turning red if Obi-Wan is with them on their planet.
```` js
style: cF( c=> c.md.withObi ? "color:red": null)
````
How will they know they are with Obi? That is another formulaic property:
```` js
withObi: cF( c=> c.md.info.homeworld.name === sithApp.obiLoc.name)
````
That raises two questions. The first is how we know their `homeworld`. We look them up:
```` js
info: cF( c=> (c.md.lookup && c.md.lookup.okResult))
````
Wait. What is that lookup? It is actually a thinly wrapped XHR:
```` js
lookup: cF( if (c.md.sithId > 0)
            return new mxXHR( DARK_JEDI_URL + c.md.sithId))
````
Why test if the ID is positive? We created five SithViews straight away, before we knew all the IDs, and for mxWeb&trade; internalese reasons populated them with bogus (negative) IDs. Anyway, once we kick off a `lookup` the `info` rule will start waiting on the result, which will flow into the formula whenever it comes back. ie, asynchronicity is a natural for data flow.

Speaking of which, where *is* Obi-Wan?
```` js
        obiTrakker: cF( c => new WebSocket('ws://localhost:4000')
                                .onmessage = msg => c.md.obiLoc = JSON.parse(msg.data)),
        obiLoc: cI( null)
````
Careful: `obiTrakker` holds the socket connection, not Obi. The asynch `onmessage` handler initiates data flow by injecting new Obi info into the `obiLoc` input Cell. Imperative meets functional. Anyway...

Instead of a "batch" mentality in which view stuff happens and then data stuff happens in a big cyclic crowd wave all rising and falling in unison, we have a crowd of individual data point fans on their mobile devices calling people or looking things up to get the information they need when they decide they need it. Getting back to coding, this means the individual developer working on some widget can focus on that widget, pulling info from a matrix of other elements as they see fit. The only rule is, no cycles.

Here is how those "pulling" formulas work at run time. 
* The user scrolls and in code not shown we simply change the list of SithIds. 
* The `UL` of SithViews sees the changed list of Ids and creates a new SithView for any new ID in the list. 
* The SithView is created with a valid SithID so its `lookup` rule fires and kicks off an XHR. 
* The `info` rule sees the lookup and asks for its `result` but gets back null. 
* When the XHR gets its response and it is OK it imperatively feeds the response into its input `result` cell. 
* The `info` cell now sees the result and takes on the result as its value and everyone watching the info fires. 
* That includes `withObi`, which may discover they are on the same planet and turn `true`.
* ....triggering the `style` rule to run and decide on "color:red".
* An observer (in the correct sense of that word) updates the style of the DOM  incarnation of the SithView.

In more code not shown:
* the div owning the two scroll buttons has a `disabled` rule watching all the SithViews to see if any are `withObi`
* Seeing one is, it turns `true`
* the individual scroll buttons decide they are disabled and...
* ...decide their classes should include a "disabled" class
* again a generic mxWeb observer updates the DOM `classlist` and button `disabled` attributes.

Sounds complex, right? Without data flow, it is. Now look at the full [data flow solution](https://github.com/kennytilton/flux-challenge/blob/master/submissions/kennytilton/js/SithTrak.js). The data flow paradigm  dissolves all that the complexity into so many simple rules. Those rules are easy to write and validate, and if we get one wrong we know exactly where to look. Those rules are as simple in a React view, but React rules do nothing to move data to where it needs to be. In the data flow paradigm, views are first-class citizens who manage their own state, arranging for the state graph to stay as current as the view.

Without Flux or Redux.
